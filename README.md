### Notes & Suggestions

- Add a concise **Project Description** at the top of your repo to help others understand the purpose quickly :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
- Without a description or topics, GitHub shows “No description” by default; consider adding them for clarity :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- Consider adding a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or issue templates as your project matures — this improves onboarding for contributions :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

You can copy this README template into your repo and adjust the placeholders accordingly. Need help tailoring tech-stack specifics, commands, or badges? Happy to assist!
